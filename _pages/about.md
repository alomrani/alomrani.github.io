I am a ML researcher at Noah's Ark Lab, Huawei.

<!--I was previously a research assistant in the Mechanical and Engineering department, where I worked with Dr. [Elias Khalil](https://ekhalil.com) on developing reinforcement learning algorithms for online matching problems. My MEng research project focused on using RL algorithms to enhance detection mechanisms at EV charging stations, under the supervision of Dr. [Deepa Kundur](https://www.comm.utoronto.ca/~dkundur/) and Dr. [Mosaddek Tushar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QBwimpcAAAAJ&hl=en).-->
