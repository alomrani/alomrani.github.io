Hello! I am a Masters of Engineering (MEng) student at the University of Toronto in the ECE departmant. My research interests lie broadly in machine learning, reinforcement learning, and discrete optimization. I was previously a research assistant in the Mechanical and Engineering departmant, where I worked with Dr. Elias Khalil on developing reinforcement learning algorithms for online matching problems. My MEng research project focused on using RL algorithms to enhance detection mechanisms at EV charging stations, under the supervision of Dr. Deepa Kundur and Dr. Mosaddeq Tushar.
