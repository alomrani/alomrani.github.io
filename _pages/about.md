Hello! I am a [Masters of Engineering]{https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/graduates/degree-programs/meng/} (MEng) student at the University of Toronto in the ECE departmant. My research interests lie broadly in machine learning, reinforcement learning, and discrete optimization. I was previously a research assistant in the Mechanical and Engineering departmant, where I worked with Dr. [Elias Khalil]{ekhalil.com} on developing reinforcement learning algorithms for online matching problems. My MEng research project focused on using RL algorithms to enhance detection mechanisms at EV charging stations, under the supervision of Dr. [Deepa Kundur]{https://www.comm.utoronto.ca/~dkundur/} and Dr. [Mosaddeq Tushar]{https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QBwimpcAAAAJ&hl=en}.
