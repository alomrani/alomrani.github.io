**Abstract**

The increased push for the adoption of green transportation has been apparent, especially in the last five years, to address the alarming increase in atmospheric CO2 levels. The success and popularity of EVs have led many carmakers to shift to the development of clean cars in the next decade. Moreover, many countries around the globe have set EV target adoption numbers, some even aiming to ban gasoline cars by 2050. Unlike their gasoline-based counterparts, EVs comprise a myriad of sensors, communication channels, and decision-making components vulnerable to cyberattacks. Hence, the unprecedented demand for EVs calls for the development of robust defenses against these increasingly sophisticated attacks. In particular, recently proposed cyberattacks demonstrate how consumers may mislead by sending false data to unlawfully receive higher charging priorities, congest charging schedules, and steal power. In this paper, we devise a learning-based detection model that can identify deceptive electric vehicles. The model is trained on an original dataset using real driving traces and a malicious dataset generated from a reinforcement learning agent. The RL (Reinforcement Learning) agent is trained to create intelligent and stealthy attacks that can evade simple detection rules while also giving a malicious EV high charging priority. We evaluate the effectiveness of the generated attacks compared to handcrafted attacks. Moreover, we show that our detection model trained with the RL-generated attacks displays greater robustness to intelligent attacks.
